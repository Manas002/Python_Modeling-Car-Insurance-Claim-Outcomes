Machine learning is very popular in the insurance market, which has long been renowned for being data-driven.  Working on behalf of On the Road car insurance, you'll investigate their customer data to identify the feature that produces the most accurate logistic regression model for them to predict whether a claim will be made against a policy!

Insurance companies invest a lot of time and money into optimizing their pricing and accurately estimating the likelihood that customers will make a claim. In many countries insurance it is a legal requirement to have car insurance in order to drive a vehicle on public roads, so the market is very large!

**Knowing all of this, On the Road car insurance have requested your services in building a model to predict whether a customer will make a claim on their insurance during the policy period. As they have very little expertise and infrastructure for deploying and monitoring machine learning models, they've asked you to identify the single feature that results in the best performing model, as measured by accuracy, so they can start with a simple model in production.**

**◎ How I approach the project :**

1. Reading in and exploring the dataset

2. Filling missing values

3. Preparing for modeling

4. Building and storing the models

5. Measuring performance

6. Finding the best performing model
